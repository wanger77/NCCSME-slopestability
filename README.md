## This repo presents a Neutrosophic confidence Cubic set based matrix energy(NCCSME) method.
The NCCSME method is a brand new method to process multi-point collection data. Also as its bulid with matrix, which is suitable for computing.
## The data of multi-point sampled slope data is open-sourced.
